#ending note1: a dividend growth rate (constant) has to differ organization by organizatgion.
#ending note2: output is very sensitive to inputs (alternative needed)
#ending note3: if rate of return < dividend growth rate --> model fails if company pay dividends although losing money/decreasing earnings.
